Development Notes

12Feb2016 - edited VisualStudio .gitIgnore file to PERMIT all SQL file types.

To Commit and Push changes up to Git do this:
   TeamExplorer >> Home >> Changes>> Add-in a comment then >> Commit&Push 


Need to also sync the same .gitIgnore file at work so all the proper files get saved to Git.

- sync/pull-down from Git  the local .gitIgnore file at work, permiting ALL SQL files to be saved.
- Commit&Push, then check to see if the sql files get pushed up into Git at work.
